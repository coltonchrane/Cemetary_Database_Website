# Cemetery_Database_Website
### Flask site developed for a cemetery needing records transferred from an old binder with handwritten entries into a full functioning database with interactivity.

** This project is for my portfolio and the client is aware I am posting the code and all personal data/link names have been removed for there privacy **. Cemetery
Database Website is a simple Python-flask site using HTML and a bootsrapped CSS. It utilizes an authentication portal and registration portal with encryption(I am aware
the sign up is only accesible by URL that is intentional).

After logging in the main directory displays every plot in the cemetary with information about the plot.

These plots have UI elements to show availibaility and formatting to make it easier to read the information.

Each plot has an edit button which will allow you to edit or update existing plots by pulling the info, or lack thereof, from the database.

The search function is very minimal and basic at the clients request future updates will
look to expand search capabilities utilizing dynamic drop downs for section nad lot. This pulls up another page with the same formatting as the directory with any search 
that matcehs the last name types in.



Finally the export report allows a user to export the current image of the cemetery's directory from the database into a formatted 
report. This was also at the clients request to be able to keep a physical back up and onboarding new memebr of the cemetery's board.
